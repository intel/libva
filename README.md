# Libva Project

Libva is an implementation for VA-API (Video Acceleration API)

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which
provides access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities
for video processing. It consists of a main library and
driver-specific acceleration backends for each supported hardware
vendor.

If you would like to contribute to libva, check our [Contributing
guide](https://github.com/intel/libva/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We also recommend taking a look at the ['janitorial'
bugs](https://github.com/intel/libva/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AJanitorial)
in our list of open issues as these bugs can be solved without an
extensive knowledge of libva.

We would love to help you start contributing!

Doxygen files are regularly updated through Github Pages and can
be accessed directly through [github pages
